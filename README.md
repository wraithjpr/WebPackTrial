# Webpack and Babel Trial

This trial works it's way through implementing the webpack guides at [webpack.js.org/guides/](https://webpack.js.org/guides/).

I didn't do the [Loading Fonts part](https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-management/#loading-fonts) in the Asset Management section because I didn't have suitable font files available. Anyway, I'll probably use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) when I build my web sites.

The project structure is adapted from Andras Toth's [Codeship post](https://blog.codeship.com/advanced-node-js-project-structure-tutorial/): _Toth, Andras; Advanced Node.js Project Structure Tutorial; 2018-04-03_.
